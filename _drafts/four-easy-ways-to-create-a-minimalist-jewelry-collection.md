![A picture of my hanging jewelry.](/assets/img/20200721_105738_0000_compress91.jpg "jewelry")I know there are some folk who do no to little jewelry, but I like to have more than that. It makes me happy. And that's the beauty of minimalism. It looks different for every single person. So if you are on a journey to declutter and minimize your life and things and jewelry has been neglected, these suggestions may help you out. Today on the blog, I'm sharing four easy ways to create a minimalist jewelry collection

 1. Pull from your clothing palette for inspiration on colours to keep. I had a ton of jewelry in so many colours and was able to minimize some by just looking at five main colours I wore in my minimal type wardrobe/capsule wardrobe (link project 333).

2\. Declutter all poor quality jewelry. It goes without saying that rusted pieces or pieces that destroy your earlobs needs to go. Yesterday. I loved these earrings, but they were low quality. I should have known better, but have learned better!

3\. Versatility. I try to focus on pieces that can be worn different ways such as a bracelet that can also be a necklace or a 3 in 1 necklace (link). Having versatility in your jewelry collection will mean you will have less pieces overall.

4\. Durability. Not easily breakable. I have four children, but even if I didn't, a good quality piece that is durable is so key! It'll stand the test of time and save you money too.

And if your wardrobe needs a total rehaul and you have a hard time knowing where to start, you may enjoy my Simple Capsule Wardrobe Guide. Some recent feedback on it: “Ahhh Kelly! That was brilliant! I’m going to do some sorting this weekend, more purging, and most importantly writing down what I have vs what I need. Thank you!!!” If you’d like that guide, feel free to email me at [eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) and I can send that off to you.

Cheers,

Kelly
