title: 6 Significant Ways to Reduce Your Screen Time
excerpt: "The struggle is real. Do you struggle with your screen time intake some
  days? Phone? Netflix? Social media? Many of us do, no shame, but there is a movement
  of folk trying to be more aware of how they are spending their time such as the
  Hands Free Mama movement. \n\nReading on the website - thriveglobal (helping the
  world’s leading enterprises unlock their people’s potential and create sustainable
  peak performance cultures...for work!). They are all about taking care of yourself
  to become more productive. I read this blog on reducing screen time and here are
  5 Significant Ways to Reduce Your Screen Time that I read:\n\n1\\. Track Your Screen
  Time  \n This is helpful because oftentimes time passes by quickly and it can often
  be more than you'd think! There are apps for this too.\n\n2\\. Delete Time-Wasting
  Apps   \n (Unless you run an online business that needs certain platforms (I work
  online- most clients on social media!), then it’s unnecessary to keep these apps
  around. They are time suckers.\n\n3\\. Set a Timer  \n Can't give up screeen time
  as much as you'd like? Using a timer can help you monitor your time.\n\n4\\.: replace
  old habit of picking up your screen with new   \n Replacing the habit of picking
  up the phone with a more positive habit, such as picking up a book or calling a
  friend.\n\n5\\. Take up a Hobby  \n Like the above, picking up instead of reaching
  for your screens. You'll be more motivated to pick up your hobby instead!\n\n6\\.
  Another thing I do is make the routines of when i use my phone. Print away at night.\n\nIf
  you got value, feel free to share via social media, but if you are marjorly struggling
  in this area, I have a quick article to read that helps you to figure out where
  and why you are using screen times too much! It's so key to discover WHY so that
  you can reduce. Tips are awesome, but without this step, it's going to be much harder
  to reduce your screen time ... send me an email at [eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com)
  message if you'd like that article.\n\n⁣"
