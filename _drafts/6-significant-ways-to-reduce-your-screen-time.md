The struggle is real. Do you struggle with your screen time intake some days? Phone? Netflix? Social media? Many of us do, no shame, but there is a movement of folk trying to be more aware of how they are spending their time such as the Hands Free Mama movement.

I was reading on the website - thriveglobal (helping the world’s leading enterprises unlock their people’s potential and create sustainable peak performance cultures...for work!). They are all about taking care of yourself to become more productive. I read their blog on reducing screen time and here are 6 Significant Ways to Reduce Your Screen Time that I read:

## 1. Track Your Screen Time

This is helpful because oftentimes time passes by quickly and it can often be more than you'd think! There are apps for this too.

## 2. Delete Time-Wasting Apps

Unless you run an online business that needs certain platforms (I work online- most of my clients I keep on touch with on social media), then it’s unnecessary to keep these apps around. They are time suckers.

## 3. Set a Timer

Can't give up screeen time as much as you'd like? Using a simple timer can help you monitor your time.r

4. Replace old habit of picking up your screen with new


4. 
5. 
6. Replacing the habit of picking up the phone with a more positive habit, such as picking up a book or calling a friend.

5\. Take up a Hobby  
Like the above, picking up instead of reaching for your screens. You'll be more motivated to pick up your hobby instead!

6\. Another thing I do is make the routines of when i use my phone. Print away at night.

If you got value, feel free to share via social media, but if you are marjorly struggling in this area, I have a quick article to read that helps you to figure out where and why you are using screen times too much! It's so key to discover WHY so that you can reduce. Tips are awesome, but without this step, it's going to be much harder to reduce your screen time ... send me an email at [eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) message if you'd like that article.
