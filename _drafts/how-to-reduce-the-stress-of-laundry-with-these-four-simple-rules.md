We have six people here at home and even with minimizing our wardrobes, it's really never-ending. Because clothes get dirty and we have to clean. them. Ya know? Laundry used to just be a bit stressful for me because there were piles here. Piles there. If you are stressed out from laundry, today's blog is for you. I'm going to be sharing how to reduce the stress of laundry with these four simple rules (obviously if one rule doesn't work for your situation, scrap it or redo for what works for you and your family!). 

## Have less clothes 

Smaller wardrobes really means less clothes in the house. We have way less stray, lonely clothes hanging out around the house because there is less to keep track of. 

## Reduce expectations 

Letting go of the expectation that it must be put away has helped our family so much. We often live out of organized laundry baskets and it works for us right now.

## Simplify organizing the laundry 

We don't separate the dirty clothes aside from cloth diapers, which saves a lot of time there too for our family. We also don't have white clothes, so I might reconsider that if we did. Ha! 

## Find simpler laundry products 

I like to use natural and multipurpose items in our laundry room and years back, I remembered hearing about magical laundry washing balls, so when [Smart Klean](https://www.smartklean.com/) laundry reached out to me on [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/eastcoastkelly) and gifted me one, I couldn't resist. I really wanted to try one! Since I started using it about a month ago, it has been saving mess and money in our laundry room. If you are on Instagram, you can also win one here plus a free stain stick (ends on June 18th). It'll save your laundry budget for a year and who doesn't love cutting the budget?!   
   
\***If giveaways aren't your thing, I also have a coupon code for you to enjoy to apply to your laundry ball order. Just send me an email at [eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) for that code.
