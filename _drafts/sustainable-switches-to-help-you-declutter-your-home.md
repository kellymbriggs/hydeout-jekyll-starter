I'm Katie, a work from home mama to 3 under 4 with a passion for simplifying, fair trade, and sustainability! I'm an extrovert who loves to be busy and living minimally has given me the freedom to spend my time doing fun things with my children and not spending my life organizing our things! I love ethical fashion, baking (former pastry chef here!) a good coffee, and all things hygge!
