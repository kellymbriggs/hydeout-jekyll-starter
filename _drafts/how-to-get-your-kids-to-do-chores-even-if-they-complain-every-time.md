This can be how it looks like here some days - you might know what I mean. The complaining. I'm not going to pretend it's perfect here. Because no home or kid is perfect. Although apparently, I was a pretty good kid with chores, according to my dad. Until I hit the teen years, that is. But, that's a story for another day. Ha! Today on the blog, I'm going to share with you how to get your kids to do chores even if they complain every time.   
   
 So what do you do if you're trying to, say, encourage your kids to tidy up their rooms?

## There's no magic answer. But consistency is close.

There's something to be said for consistent routines and habits. It doesn't mean it'll always be easy, but it can as simple as being consistent. For instance, a part of our quiet time routine is for my kids to do a bedroom tidy task or few every single weekday afternoon. Since I put this into place, there has become less and less resistance to this part of their quiet time routine because it's becoming habit for them. We do it every day and they know what to expect. It does not mean they never complain or just straight up not do it, but it means - in general, it's built into their days. A habit, a routine. That becomes much easier for them to do because it's just a part of their day. My friend [Robin](https://www.instagram.com/mylittlerobins/) put together a book on habits called [_Habits for the Early Years_](https://mylittlerobins.com/habits-early-years-journal/) and [_The 7 Habits of Happy Kids _](https://amzn.to/31cXVrC)if you'd like to read more on the subject of cultivating habits in kids.

## Make it simple and start small 

I mean that's probably an obvious one, but I know for my kids if I say... Clean up the whole room, house, etc it's just too overwhelming for them. So starting simple, especially when they are younger is so key. I want to set my kids up for success and have a feeling of accomplishment every time they do a chore. 

## Pick age appropriate chores

Like above, I want my kids to feel a sense of accomplishment when they do chores, so being able to pick age appropriate chores will certainly help in that department too.   
   
 Afterall...the hope for my kids - going forward in life:

And routines that build good habits, I've found, have been 100% worth it so far.   
   
_PS if chores is an area you'd like to work on with your kids, my mail list is receiving a free sheet of age appropriate suggestions for chores for kids this Friday! If you're not on it yet (why not? ðŸ˜‰), you can send me an email at_ [_eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com_](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) _to get that freebie._  
   
Cheers,
