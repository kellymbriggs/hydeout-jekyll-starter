I'm feeling this a lot lately. Like sometimes I wish extra time would magically appear so I can do more fun things (I'm not talking about extra time for housework ha!). Do you wish you had more time to do the things you love more? Oftentimes, it's just a matter of what we do with our time and understanding our priorities better. So today I'm going to share a planning process I use that's been helpful to me that may be helpful to you too: How to find extra time even with living a busy mom life.

## It's all about the goals

Take a bit of time to ⁣visualize and write down your goals and values... who you want to become. Such as - healthier, stronger, hosting more friends in our home. Less time watching tv, more time reading. etc. ⁣You can revisit this process in the future too and tweak them as you go.

## Prioritizing is important

Make a [priority pyramid](https://www.eastcoastkelly.com/planning/2020/04/14/how-a-priority-pyramid-can-change-your-life.html) from most to least important to refer to when you get distracted. Example: Is an hour scrolling social media helping you to become what you want, according to how you visualize yourself, your goals, or looking at your priorities? What's #1? And so on.

And then put non priority tasks low, low on the list. For me, that's been me mostly putting them on the weekends so that I don't get sucked in during the week! It's been really helpful. Including doing things like mending my pants. Important, but not essential or priority.⁣

Helpful? How do you look at the time you are given and fit in the things you love doing?⁣

_And if you are majorly struggling in this area, the book_ [_Eat That Frog!_](https://amzn.to/2Vamm5j): 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time _is soooo helpful. The_ [_author_](https://www.briantracy.com/) _has researched time management for years so he knows what he’s talking about and has 1.5 million copies sold of his book. If you’d like a quick recap of all of the ways he suggests to beat procrastination and really simple time management tips, send me at email at eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com and I’d be happy to send you that recap._

Cheers,

Kelly
