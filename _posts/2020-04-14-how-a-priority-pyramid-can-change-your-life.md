We know what priorities are and what they mean, but how do we really know what comes first? Today on the blog I'm going to share with you a visual way to structure and organize your priorities using a priority pyramid.

## Brainstorm your important areas of life

Take some time and write down all of the things that are important to you. Organize them into groups from least to most important. It’s important to do this step because in the heat of the moment in your day, you can refer to the pyramid to know which is the most important to focus on first. I originally found this idea from [House Unseen](www.instagram.com/houseunseen) on Instagram and it really helped me going forward when I felt burnt out or overwhelmed. It helped me to see clearly what I needed to prioritize.

Example of an ordered priority pyramid – it’ll look different for everyone:

## Put Your Priority Pyramid into Practice

A priority pyramid is meant to be a tool, something to help you out when needed. Refer to it often when you are faced with overwhelm in your day too. It may help refocus you on what matters most! Keep it in a place where you may see it often if that’s helpful.

Was this helpful? If you enjoyed this, I’d love it if you shared it below.   
   
PS want to dive into discovering your priorities for your Priority Pyramid a bit more? I have a list of 20 other possible priorities for you to look at that you may want to include. Just send me an email at [eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) for that list.
