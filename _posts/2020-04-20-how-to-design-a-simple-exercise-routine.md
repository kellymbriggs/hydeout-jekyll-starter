A while back, I was helping my hubby come up with a simple exercise plan for himself to do before work that didn't require a lot of space or equipment. I remembered reading about how the Minimalists stripped back to a simple exercise routine in their book [Everything that Remains](https://www.amazon.ca/Everything-That-Remains-Memoir-Minimalists/dp/1938793188) after ditching going to the gym to save on money and time. And then I found a blog with more details on it [here](https://www.theminimalists.com/18min/). My husband was easily able to make his own too! 

## Using HIIT routines: what are they?

Recently my friend Terri shared that she uses HIIT routines for her workouts, so I thought to look into that further. 

According to [Fitnessblender.com](https://www.fitnessblender.com/articles/what-is-hiit-and-how-do-i-use-it-in-my-training), 

> **"**[**High intensity interval training**](https://www.fitnessblender.com/videos/bodyweight-hiit-cardio-workout-sweaty-at-home-cardio-hiit) or HIIT is defined as short, intense, unsustainable bursts of physical activity, paired with intervals of quick rests. This type of intense training causes a sort of metabolic disturbance which can result in the body burning calories at a higher rate up to 48-72 hours later. HIIT can also increase metabolism, reduce insulin resistance, improve cardiac function, produce faster gains in endurance levels than steady state cardio training and can be an effective way to recruit/build type 2 fast twitch muscle."

And I found out there were tons of ways to do HIIT routines and exercises, so I sat down and wrote up a simple plan for myself taking from various ideas out there that I found. Today on the blog I'm going to share with you how to design a simple exercise routine whether you have 5 or 30 minutes and beyond. It's what I'm currently doing for my daily exercise too and thought it may help you out. 

## My current simple exercise routine

1. Pick two cardio exercises such as burpees or jumping jacks.
2. Pick one lower exercise such as squats or lunges.
3. Pick one upper exercise such as push ups or bench dips.
4. Pick one core exercise such as planks or crunches.

Notes:

* Repeat the above routine X amount of times that you want (I'm currently doing 10 and 15 minutes..hoping to work that up). Each time through is 5 minutes.
* Each individual exercise is 50 seconds, followed by ten seconds of rest.
* Find a HIIT timer that does 50 seconds, 10 seconds. You can find an app or a YouTube video that can do this. I use this one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nRDPNGj2EU&list=PL9VK7qHep7EdvuE-Ux_hVKsADmizewBA5&index=2&t=609s) for when I do 15 minutes.

_And that's it!_ 

If you'd like a simple worksheet to fill in your own simple exercise routine and with a few more exercise suggestions for each category, I can send you my personal setup too. Although they are all exercises that I know well and enjoy. Feel free to send me an email at eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com if you'd like that worksheet for free.

Cheers,

Kelly
