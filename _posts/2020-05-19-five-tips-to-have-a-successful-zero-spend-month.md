I have been sharing weekly minimal living tips with [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/eastcoastkelly/) friends and thought I'd share my tips here for you too today.

_What's a zero spend budget?_ According to [this blog](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zbb.asp)...(they call it zero-based budgeting, but same concept essentialy):

> Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a method of budgeting in which all [expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expense.asp) must be justified for each new period. The process of zero-based budgeting starts from a "zero base," and every function within an organization is analyzed for its needs and costs. [Budgets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp) are then built around what is needed for the upcoming period, regardless of whether each budget is higher or lower than the previous one.

## Want to try out a zero spend month too? Five tips to have a successful zero spend month:

#### 1. Hold off on anything that is not immediate. Giving time to think about if you really need something

#### 2. Buy second hand where possible⁣⁣⁣  
3\. Trade if you can  
4\. Avoid "window shopping"⁣⁣⁣  
5\. Cut back on extras (like that extra coffee when you could bring your awesome one from home, for instance)⁣⁣⁣

And what's been working really well for us lately is sticking to a - zero spend budget too. We keep it simple - it's more of a mindset than a list of rules. Essentially, we don't spend unless necessary, simplify, and streamline it all.⁣ We've ended up saving a lot of money faster this way too. Which is the goal, right? Little purchases used to add up so quickly for us, so this shift has been huge for us.⁣⁣ We check in to our spending habits during a part of our monthly routine check in with our finances.  
⁣⁣  
What does it look like on paper for us? Instead of setting aside certain amounts for spending areas (which in the past I'd want to spend if we didn't dip into it), we just track every purchase and take a look at it throughout the month and at the end of the month going forward. Talking about it. Did we really need xyz? And to make new "rules" going forward. Mindful budgeting and saving.

_Want to get started with the zero spend method we use? I have a simple spending tracker monthly worksheet for you that'll help you clearly see what areas you need to work on very quickly. It's been so helpful for us. Since we started doing zero spending mindset for our budgeting, we’ve finally made a significant dent in our savings for our basement reno. Feel free to email me at_ [_eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com_](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) _for that tracker for free!_

Cheers,

Kelly
