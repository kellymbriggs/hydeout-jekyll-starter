We're all on a journey and there comes a point in our lives where we see what needs to go so very clearly. I started my deep physical declutter for our home a handful of years ago, but through that time I read from [Joshua Becker](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/) and others that it's more than just the physical clutter. Mental declutter is there too. Holding us back from what matters most. Today on the blog I'm sharing about three things to declutter that most people miss.

## Declutter screen distractions

I caught myself watching way too much Netflix a couple months ago. I felt icky. Because I let it suck me in. A couple months ago, I started to not open social media until after my morning routine (see what my morning routine looks like [here](https://www.eastcoastkelly.com/morning%20routine/2020/04/21/how-to-have-a-morning-routine-with-children-around.html)) and what a difference that has been too when I follow through with that. I still catch myself sometimes, of course.

## Declutter overscheduling

Do we say yes too much to everything? Are we exhausted with no down time? Are our kids? Time to reassess what matters most in this area. By taking a good look at who you want to become. I know this has been a good time right now during the pandemic for many of us to check in on what we are prioritizing and putting on our to do lists.

## Declutter toxic relationships

This one is so, so tough. But it's good to reassess those relationships in your life. The book [Boundaries](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B06XFKNB2Y/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) really, really helped me to see how to declutter in this area. What's a toxic relationship? I found a [Time Magazine article](https://time.com/5274206/toxic-relationship-signs-help/) that goes over what it looks like in detail.

> [Dr. Lillian Glass](https://www.drlillianglass.com/dr-lillian-glass-communication-psychology-of-human-behavior-bio/), a California-based communication and psychology expert who says she coined the term in her 1995 book [_Toxic People_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1929873441/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=time037-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1929873441&linkId=eaf50ccdc873011883d4796928e9b6a3), defines a toxic relationship as “any relationship \[between people who\] don’t support each other, where there’s conflict and one seeks to undermine the other, where there’s competition, where there’s disrespect and a lack of cohesiveness.

And if you are feeling bogged down in life, it might be time to take a look at what you need to declutter. And then ask yourself:

**What can I remove from my life today?  
What can I add that fills me up?**_  
  
Focusing on what matters most to you.

_And if you’d like a simple, low key place to start, I have a 30 day declutter challenge that you may like. I’ve had folk message me and tell me they have bags of donations after a few days of it! Send me an email at_ [_eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com_](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) _if you’d like that._

_Cheers,_

Kelly
