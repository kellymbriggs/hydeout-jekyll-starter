The struggle is real. Do you struggle with your screen time intake some days? Many of us do, no shame, but there is a movement of folk trying to be more aware of how they are spending their time such as the [Hands Free Mama](https://www.handsfreemama.com/) movement. I was also reading on the website - [Thrive Global ](https://thriveglobal.com/)(helping the world’s leading enterprises unlock their people’s potential and create sustainable peak performance cultures...for work!). They are all about taking care of yourself to become more productive. I read their blog on reducing screen time and here are 5 significant ways to reduce your screen time that I'm recapping and adding my own twist too:

## 1. Track your screen time

This is helpful because oftentimes time passes by quickly and it can often be more than you'd think! How often do I sit down to do something, get distracted, and then BAM! It's been 30 mins, an hour, etc. Sound familiar? And. There are [apps](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-apps-for-limiting-your-screen-time/) for this too if you're an app person.

## 2. Delete time-wasting apps

Unless you run an online business that needs certain platforms (I work online- most of my clients I keep in touch with are on social media, for instance), then it’s unnecessary to keep these apps around. Or another idea I've read about is setting a boundary for yourself to only check in on desktop vs mobile.

## 3. Set a timer

Can't give up screen time as much as you'd like? Using a simple timer can help you monitor your time. Decide in advance how much time you'd like to spend, such as 15 minutes. Set and go. I often just use google's timer by typing in to google: "set 15 minute timer".

## 4. Replace your habit of picking up your screen with a new one

Replacing the habit of picking up your phone with a different habit, such as picking up a book or calling a friend.

## 5. Set specific times and routines for using your screens

You could set routines for yourself like: Mornings are only for using it during my morning routine, I put my phone away at 10 every night. I only use my phone for work..and so on.

And if you are majorly struggling in this area, I have a quick article to read that helps you to figure out where and why you are using screens too much! It's so key to discover WHY so that you can reduce if that's what you'd like to do. Tips are awesome, but without this step, it's going to be much harder to reduce your screen time ... send me an email at [eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) if you'd like to read that article too.

Cheers,
