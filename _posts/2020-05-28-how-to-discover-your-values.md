Firstly, let's set the stage. What are values exactly? 

> In ethics, value denotes the degree of importance of some thing or action, with the aim of determining what actions are best to do or what way is best to live, or to describe the significance of different actions. - Wikipedia

Today on the blog, I'll be sharing with you a bit about what some of my values are and I will be giving you a simple exercise for you to discover some of yours too.   
 _  
Want to figure out quickly what your true values are?_ _Take a moment and do this simple exercise:_  
   
Take a look at what you do, your actions. What things do you do on the daily? Such as: Do you get outside? Exercise? Choose eating healthy? Family time? Watch Netflix? Journal? Pray? Read? Do your hair? Listen attentively? This list could go on, but take some time to think, and perhaps quickly jot down those that come to mind. During this step, you may also notice that what you thought you valued doesn't actually show in your day to day actions. Take note of that too   
   
**Here are some of my values that came from me writing my daily actions down:**

* I value growth. Daily time spent growing in areas I want to grow in (i.e. spiritual, learning new things, hobbies, business development etc). 
* I value close family relationships. I take time daily to check in with my people. And listen to what they are sharing with me. 
* I value hard work. To give my all at what I do. 
* I value taking care of myself to take care of others: spiritual, physical, and mental...daily.   
     
  Maybe through the above exercise, you'll also discover what you thought you valued, but really don't based on your actions. I thought I valued getting outside....but haven't been getting out much this year since having the new baby. But it's something I want to change for this year. Values can also change over time too. I hope you enjoyed and learned something new about yourself through this exercise. Happy exploring your values!  
     
  _If you enjoyed this type of exercise, another way to expand this is into creating a family motto for your family... if youâ€™d like a simple template and examples of 30 family values to start drafting your own family motto, feel free to send me an email at_ [_eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com_](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) _for those free resources I found for you._  
     
  Cheers,

  Kelly
