![Title of blog on my planner with flowers.](/assets/img/20200630_101240_0000.png "plannerflowers")

About four years ago, I clearly remember standing in the kitchen. With my scrap of paper filled with my to do list. I felt unbelievably stressed out and overwhelmed. I didn't know which way was up or down. At this point in my life, I think we were at two, maybe three kids, and I was home full time. It was around this moment that I knew there had to be a better way. Today on the blog, I'm sharing how to start minimalism with these two steps I go over below. 

## 1. Start. Just start. Somewhere. 

It was that moment in my kitchen that I turned even more to decluttering and reading [Marie Kondo](https://konmari.com/)'s book [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up](https://amzn.to/2AhtdCJ) and then stumbling upon the [bullet journal method](https://amzn.to/2YMIpkA) thereafter. I decluttered our home ruthlessly, questioning everything. And then fine tuned as the years went on. Everyone starts somewhere and this was my somewhere. The place you start will be different from the next and that's ok.   
   
Some places that offer more hands on help:

* My friend [Lisa on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lisatselebidis/) has a tidy project going on! She’s a konmari consultant.
* [A 12 week uncluttered course](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/get-uncluttered/) by Joshua Becker ([Becoming Minimalist](http://www.becomingminimalist.com/)).

## 2. Minimize your to do list. 

Looking at your to do list can be a great place to start minimizing. Look at what's there and take things off that are not in line with who you are, where you want to go in life. My blog on [discovering your values](https://www.eastcoastkelly.com/planning/2020/05/28/how-to-discover-your-values.html) will help you out too if you are not sure where to start.  
   
Minimalism, for me, has reduced not just the physical stuff around me, but also a lottttt of mental clutter. There is just less on my to do list and also a way to organize my thoughts much better (I use the [bullet journal method](https://amzn.to/2YMIpkA)). It's helped me to get rid of the excess and see what's been really important for me. And in turn, I notice myself less stressed. Less anxious. Because there's just less noise/stuff/tasks before my days.   
   
Start looking within and around you to see what you can do without. Less stress. Less on the to do list. Less stuff. And go from there. Taking it one day at a time.  
   
_And if you’d like a simple, low key place to start, I have a 30 day declutter challenge that you may like. I’ve had folk message me and tell me they have bags of donations after a few days of it! Send me an email at_ [_eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com_](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) _if you’d like that._

 To your minimalist journey! 

Cheers,

Kelly
