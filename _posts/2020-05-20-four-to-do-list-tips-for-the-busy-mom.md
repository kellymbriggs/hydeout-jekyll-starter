You are worth so much more than the size of your crossed off to do list. But goodness knows those lists can also help in the time of decluttering or other pressing matters. Have an unending to do list? Feel like you are never on top of things? Today on the blog I'm going to leave you with some to do list tips I read in a [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/vanessaloder/2014/06/02/five-best-to-do-list-tips/#3e25cede651b) that were simple and practical and perfect for busy moms.

1. **Keep things simple**. Focusing on three things or less is what is recommended. 
2. **Write your list in advance**, ideally the night before. It allows for direction and clarity going forward. 
3. **Start right away** in the morning when you have the most energy. 
4. **Do a brain dump** if you feel the need to have a massive to do list and then set aside to reflect and look on in the future.   
      
    I use to do lists for a lot. But daily to dos I put in my [bullet journal](http://www.bulletjournal.com/).

   _If you liked these tips and love your to do lists or want to get better at them, learning the simple bullet journal method may be for you too! I have some great links to get you started with using this method if that sounds like something that would be helpful. Feel free to send me an email at eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com for those links._
