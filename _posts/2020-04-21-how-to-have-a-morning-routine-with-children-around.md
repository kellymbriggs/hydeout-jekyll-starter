Images of 5am mornings, quiet cups of coffee alone before the kids wake up. Seems like a dream to you? You are not alone. Here's the truth: not every morning routine has to be or will look like this. Today on the blog I'm going to share with you ways to have a morning routine even if you have children, especially little children around (my children are currently 9, 6, 4, and 1 for reference).

## Get up when you want to

If sleeping in or lounging around is your jam, do that. And if you can when you wake up (whatever time it is), here's a spot where you can get in some of your morning routine time too. Prayer, quiet, an ebook. My two little people are usually here with me too during this part of my morning routine.

## Work around what you are given

My kids are generally slow breakfast eaters and mostly quiet, so I'll sneak in some time here too. Reading and writing usually. If you know you can get quiet during play doh time or a tv show, sneak in time here, too. Be creative! It'll look different for each person.

_Here's what I'm doing currently that's working for me_:  
I get up when my two littlest are awake, anywhere from 6:30-7:30. I usually do my prayer, reading, daily gratitude, and a few other small things in bed. I usually do a bit of writing at another point, sometimes at the breakfast table. Ideally I like to finish most of it before breakfast, but sometimes I continue with the kids at the table (I pop on an audiobook for them on those days).

## Do what works for you and don't compare

What others do may not work for you. If it becomes more of a fight, then take it as a sign that it just might be the wrong strategy or time of a day. If it's important to you, you'll find a way. Keep going!

Last year, I finally started a morning routine for myself and it's really helped my days out so much. I feel more peaceful throughout the rest of the day and I'm finding time for those things that matter most to me. It was after I read the book [The Miracle Morning]() that everything clicked for me. I was so inspired. If you'd like a quick breakdown of what the Miracle Morning is, I can send you a basic overview from what I read. Feel free to email me at eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com if you'd like that.

Cheers,

Kelly
