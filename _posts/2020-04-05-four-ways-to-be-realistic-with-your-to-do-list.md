title: Four Ways to Be Realistic with Your To Do List
excerpt: "You are worth so much more than the size of your crossed off to do list.
  \U0001F4C3 But goodness knows those lists can also help in the time of decluttering
  or other pressing matters.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  \n  \nHave an unending to do list? Feel like you
  are never on top of things?   \n⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  \nToday on the blog I'm going to leave you
  with some to do list tips I read in a [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2020/02/20/how-to-put-together-a-realistic-to-do-list-every-day/#21767f8f19e3)
  that were simple and practical:⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  \n⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣\n\n**Keep things simple**\n\nKeep
  things simple. Focusing on three things or less is what is recommended.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ Otherwise,
  you'll end up with a ton on your list and that will just lead to overwhelm and perhaps
  the feeling of failure since you set your expectations too high!\n\n**Write your
  list in advance**\n\nWrite your list in advance, ideally the night before. It allows
  for direction and clarity going forward.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣\n\n**Start right away when you have
  the most energy**\n\nStart right away in the morning when you have the most energy.
  ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣I remember reading in Mel Robbin's book [The Five Second Rule](https://melrobbins.com/)
  about how she shares that mornings are when we have the most energy. The first few
  hours of the day! So, get your productive to do list juices going as soon as possible
  basically.\n\n**Do a brain dump**\n\nDo a brain dump if you feel the need to have
  a massive to do list and then set aside to reflect and look on in the future.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
  \ \n  \nI use to do lists for a lot of things and keep running lists of them for
  future reference. But, my daily to do list is written in my [bullet journal ](http://bulletjournal.com/)planner.\n\n![](assets/img/91490657_10163239409575627_903658426133905408_o.jpg)\n\n
  \ \n⁣⁣⁣⁣Helpful? ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  \n  \nIf you liked these tips and love your to do lists

  for you too! I have some great links to get you started with using this method if
