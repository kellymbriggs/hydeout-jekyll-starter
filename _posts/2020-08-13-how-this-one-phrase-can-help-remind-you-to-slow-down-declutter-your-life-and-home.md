**Keep it simple.**

A quote that has stayed with me since I started simplifying and minimizing my life and our life at home has been just the phrase: Keep it simple. Today on the blog, Iâ€™m sharing how keeping it simple can help remind you to slow down, declutter your life and home.

_But now I know better_. I remind myself often to keep it simple. **And keeping it simple has led to less stress, less busywork**. And way more making space for honouring the person and mom I am every day.

## Ways I've learned to keep it simple over the years?

* Saying no to keeping up with housework. See [my blog](https://www.eastcoastkelly.com/cleaning%20&%20tidying/2020/04/22/how-to-design-a-simple-cleaning-routine.html) on how I keep housework flexible now.
* Saying no to keeping up with laundry (all put away perfectly). See [my blog on my laundry routine](https://www.eastcoastkelly.com/cleaning%20&%20tidying/2020/04/30/our-current-laundry-routine-that-has-taken-the-stress-off-of-laundry.html).
* Saying no to complicated homeschool curriculum and trying to pull things out of my head. See [my blog on our slow and simple homeschooling routine](https://www.eastcoastkelly.com/routines/2020/07/22/our-slow-and-simple-homeschooling-routine.html).
* Saying no to complicating my huge so called daily priority business tasks and went down to the MOST important.
* Saying no to being a pinterest mom and embraced the mom I am: a dirt and cardboard loving mom.
* Saying no to filling my house with decor stuff just because I thought I had to.

There are so many ways that phrase "keep it simple" has affected my life since I embraced a life of living more simply. And I'm so looking forward to seeing how it evolves for me over time too.

**Further reading?**

I recommend the book [Slow: Simple Living for a Frantic World](https://amzn.to/3iE8gCI).
