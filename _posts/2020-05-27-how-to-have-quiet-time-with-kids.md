I don't know about you, but by the time I'm done lunch, I'm pooped. My ears. My body. My everything just needs some down time. I have four children, two with higher demands as they are both under five, so rest and quiet is needed for all of us. And we take that time every afternoon. We call it quiet time in our house. Today on the blog, I'm sharing with you how to have a quiet time routine with kids (and by taking a look at what we do).

## Keep things simple

Anytime I try to do anything elaborate, I find I always end up dropping it, so if you are new to quiet the idea of quiet time, start small. Keeping things simple will make quiet time that much more doable long term. Test and try different things over time, too.

## The key is consistency

If you really desire a quiet time for your family, know that it may get harder before it gets easier. New things are just harder to implement because they are new. But, from nine years of quiet time over here, the upfront work was definitely worth it! I really look forward to quiet time every day and the kids do too (most of the time).

## A look at our quiet time right now

While I put the baby for a nap at 1, my boys:

* Tidy their rooms, usually one to two tidy tasks if it’s more of a mess.
* Read an assigned school reading.
* Listen to audiobooks.
* Watch two shows…and don't bug mom. Ha!

When my baby is asleep, I am usually in my office working. Answering emails, listening to music with the odd interruption here and there. I take some time to close my eyes and rest with the baby before this too.

And don’t take it just from me, [here’s a blog](https://blog.outschool.com/quiet-time-benefits/) that goes over the research of the benefits of quiet time for kids. Fascinating!

_I also recently put together a step by step simple template for quiet time if you'd like that too. Send me an email at_ [_eastcoastkelly.com_](http://eastcoastkelly.com/) _if you'd like that and I'd be happy to share. In fact, I'm so passionate about quiet time that I'd be happy to chat with you to figure out your individual needs as a family for quiet time._

Cheers,

Kelly
